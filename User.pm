=head1 NAME

User - API for locating user information regardless of OS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use User;

  my $cfg = Config::IniFiles->new
        (
          -file    => sprintf("%s/%s", User->Home, ".ncfg"),
          -default => 'Default'
        );

  print "Your login is ", User->Login, "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is allows applications to retrieve per-user characteristics.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item Home

Returns a location that can be expected to be a users "Home" directory
on either Windows or Unix.

While one way of writing this would be to check for operating system
and then check the expected location for an operation system of that type,
I chose to do the following:

 sub Home {

  return $ENV{HOME}        if $ENV{HOME};
  return $ENV{USERPROFILE} if $ENV{USERPROFILE};
  return  "";

 }

In other words, if $HOME is defined in the user's environment, then
that is used. Otherwise $USERPROFILE is used. Otherwise "" is returned.

A contribution for Macintosh (or any other number of OS/arch combinations) is
greatly solicited.

=item Login

Returns login id of user on either Unix or NT by checking C<getlogin>,
C<getpwuid>, and various environment variables.
